AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation,
articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, blogs and UNIX man
pages.  AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including
HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.  AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the
AsciiDoc source file syntax and the backend output markups (which can
be almost any type of SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended
by the user.

**********************************************************************
This is an overly large document, it probably needs to be refactored
into a Tutorial, Quick Reference and Formal Reference.

If you're new to AsciiDoc read this section and the <<X6,Getting
Started>> section and take a look at the example AsciiDoc (`*.txt`)
source files in the distribution `doc` directory.
**********************************************************************


Introduction
------------
AsciiDoc is a plain text human readable/writable document format that
can be translated to DocBook or HTML using the asciidoc(1) command.
You can then either use asciidoc(1) generated HTML directly or run
asciidoc(1) DocBook output through your favorite DocBook toolchain or
use the AsciiDoc a2x(1) toolchain wrapper to produce PDF, EPUB, DVI,
LaTeX, PostScript, man page, HTML and text formats.

The AsciiDoc format is a useful presentation format in its own right:
AsciiDoc markup is simple, intuitive and as such is easily proofed and
edited.

AsciiDoc is light weight: it consists of a single Python script and a
bunch of configuration files. Apart from asciidoc(1) and a Python
interpreter, no other programs are required to convert AsciiDoc text
files to DocBook or HTML. See <<X11,Example AsciiDoc Documents>>
below.

Text markup conventions tend to be a matter of (often strong) personal
preference: if the default syntax is not to your liking you can define
your own by editing the text based asciidoc(1) configuration files.
You can also create configuration files to translate AsciiDoc
documents to almost any SGML/XML markup.

asciidoc(1) comes with a set of configuration files to translate
AsciiDoc articles, books and man pages to HTML or DocBook backend
formats.

.My AsciiDoc Itch
**********************************************************************
DocBook has emerged as the de facto standard Open Source documentation
format. But DocBook is a complex language, the markup is difficult to
read and even more difficult to write directly -- I found I was
spending more time typing markup tags, consulting reference manuals
and fixing syntax errors, than I was writing the documentation.

Getting Started
---------------
Installing AsciiDoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See the `README` and `INSTALL` files for install prerequisites and
procedures. Packagers take a look at <<X38,Packager Notes>>.

[[X11]]
Example AsciiDoc Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The best way to quickly get a feel for AsciiDoc is to view the
AsciiDoc web site and/or distributed examples:

- Take a look at the linked examples on the AsciiDoc web site home
  page {website}.  Press the 'Page Source' sidebar menu item to view
  corresponding AsciiDoc source.
- Read the `*.txt` source files in the distribution `./doc` directory
  along with the corresponding HTML and DocBook XML files.


AsciiDoc Document Types
-----------------------
There are three types of AsciiDoc documents: article, book and
manpage. All document types share the same AsciiDoc format with some
minor variations. If you are familiar with DocBook you will have
noticed that AsciiDoc document types correspond to the same-named
DocBook document types.

Use the asciidoc(1) `-d` (`--doctype`) option to specify the AsciiDoc
document type -- the default document type is 'article'.

By convention the `.txt` file extension is used for AsciiDoc document
source files.

article
~~~~~~~
Used for short documents, articles and general documentation.  See the
AsciiDoc distribution `./doc/article.txt` example.

AsciiDoc defines standard DocBook article frontmatter and backmatter
<<X93,section markup templates>> (appendix, abstract, bibliography,
glossary, index).

book
~~~~
Books share the same format as articles, with the following
differences:

- The part titles in multi-part books are <<X17,top level titles>>
  (same level as book title).
- Some sections are book specific e.g. preface and colophon.

Book documents will normally be used to produce DocBook output since
DocBook processors can automatically generate footnotes, table of
contents, list of tables, list of figures, list of examples and
indexes.

AsciiDoc defines standard DocBook book frontmatter and backmatter
<<X93,section markup templates>> (appendix, dedication, preface,
bibliography, glossary, index, colophon).

.Example book documents
Book::
  The `./doc/book.txt` file in the AsciiDoc distribution.

Multi-part book::
  The `./doc/book-multi.txt` file in the AsciiDoc distribution.

manpage
~~~~~~~
Used to generate roff format UNIX manual pages.  AsciiDoc manpage
documents observe special header title and section naming conventions
-- see the <<X1,Manpage Documents>> section for details.

AsciiDoc defines the 'synopsis' <<X93,section markup template>> to
generate the DocBook `refsynopsisdiv` section.

See also the asciidoc(1) man page source (`./doc/asciidoc.1.txt`) from
the AsciiDoc distribution.

AsciiDoc Backends
-----------------
The asciidoc(1) command translates an AsciiDoc formatted file to the
backend format specified by the `-b` (`--backend`) command-line
option. asciidoc(1) itself has little intrinsic knowledge of backend
formats, all translation rules are contained in customizable cascading
configuration files. Backend specific attributes are listed in the
<<X88,Backend Attributes>> section.

docbook45::
  Outputs DocBook XML 4.5 markup.

html4::
  This backend generates plain HTML 4.01 Transitional markup.

xhtml11::
  This backend generates XHTML 1.1 markup styled with CSS2. Output
  files have an `.html` extension.

html5::
  This backend generates HTML 5 markup, apart from the inclusion of
  <<X98,audio and video block macros>> it is functionally identical to
  the 'xhtml11' backend.

slidy::
  Use this backend to generate self-contained
  http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/[Slidy] HTML slideshows for
  your web browser from AsciiDoc documents. The Slidy backend is
  documented in the distribution `doc/slidy.txt` file and
  {website}slidy.html[online].

wordpress::
  A minor variant of the 'html4' backend to support
  http://srackham.wordpress.com/blogpost1/[blogpost].

latex::
  Experimental LaTeX backend.

Backend Aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Backend aliases are alternative names for AsciiDoc backends.  AsciiDoc
comes with two backend aliases: 'html' (aliased to 'xhtml11') and
'docbook' (aliased to 'docbook45').

You can assign (or reassign) backend aliases by setting an AsciiDoc
attribute named like `backend-alias-<alias>` to an AsciiDoc backend
name. For example, the following backend alias attribute definitions
appear in the `[attributes]` section of the global `asciidoc.conf`
configuration file:

  backend-alias-html=xhtml11
  backend-alias-docbook=docbook45

[[X100]]
Backend Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The asciidoc(1) `--backend` option is also used to install and manage
backend <<X101,plugins>>.

- A backend plugin is used just like the built-in backends.
- Backend plugins <<X27,take precedence>> over built-in backends with
  the same name.
- You can use the `{asciidoc-confdir}` <<X60, intrinsic attribute>> to
  refer to the built-in backend configuration file location from
  backend plugin configuration files.
- You can use the `{backend-confdir}` <<X60, intrinsic attribute>> to
  refer to the backend plugin configuration file location.
- By default backends plugins are installed in
  `$HOME/.asciidoc/backends/<backend>` where `<backend>` is the
  backend name.


DocBook
-------
AsciiDoc generates 'article', 'book' and 'refentry'
http://www.docbook.org/[DocBook] documents (corresponding to the
AsciiDoc 'article', 'book' and 'manpage' document types).

Most Linux distributions come with conversion tools (collectively
called a toolchain) for <<X12,converting DocBook files>> to
presentation formats such as Postscript, HTML, PDF, EPUB, DVI,
PostScript, LaTeX, roff (the native man page format), HTMLHelp,
JavaHelp and text.  There are also programs that allow you to view
DocBook files directly, for example http://live.gnome.org/Yelp[Yelp]
(the GNOME help viewer).

[[X12]]
Converting DocBook to other file formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DocBook files are validated, parsed and translated various
presentation file formats using a combination of applications
collectively called a DocBook 'tool chain'. The function of a tool
chain is to read the DocBook markup (produced by AsciiDoc) and
transform it to a presentation format (for example HTML, PDF, HTML
Help, EPUB, DVI, PostScript, LaTeX).

A wide range of user output format requirements coupled with a choice
of available tools and stylesheets results in many valid tool chain
combinations.
